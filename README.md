# Getting Started with Create React App

# At first create a folder called React-recipe

# To add react files in the recipe f0lder we need to do
    - npx create-react-app ./

# We will use version control using git-
    - git init
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "first commit"
    - git branch -M main
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/SamaelMarjan/recipes.git
    - git push -u origin main

# to pust the existing repository 
    - git add .
    - git commit -m ""
    - git branch -M main
    - git push -u origin main

# After the installation of react we will delete all the unneccecery file from src folder
    - App.css
    - App.test.js
    - logo.svg
    - reportWebVitals.js
    - setupTests.js

# And then we need to add a component folder and create a file called -
    - Meal.jsx
